This project is very, very rough and still incomplete. 
After talking with Student Care about some fairly serious 
and unpredictable health issues that I've regretably been 
experiencing, it was agreed that I turn in something for 
now, so as to come back to it later on at the end of the course.

I apologize for how rough and incomplete the project is in its current state! 
I just haven't had the time to commit to it as I would've wanted.


This is what I have for now. 

A very bare bones structure. 

The links in the menu should connect to the other pages. 

The social media icons should connect to general web pages, 
although they are just fillers and don't link to my real accounts.

The CSS styling is extremely rough as well and 
I am still figuring out how to make the page 100% responsive with Bootstrap.

I tried embedding 4 youtube videos which doesn't seem to be working.

I also tried embedding 4 images, which only the one in the header shows for some reason.
